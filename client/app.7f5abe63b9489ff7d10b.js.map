A URL pattern consists of a path pattern, optionally followed by '?' and a list\n\t * of search parameters. Multiple search parameter names are separated by '&'. Search parameters\n\t * do not influence whether or not a URL is matched, but their values are passed through into\n\t * the matched parameters returned by {@link ui.router.util.type:UrlMatcher#methods_exec exec}.\n\t *\n\t * Path parameter placeholders can be specified using simple colon/catch-all syntax or curly brace\n\t * syntax, which optionally allows a regular expression for the parameter to be specified:\n\t *\n\t * * `':'` name - colon placeholder\n\t * * `'*'` name - catch-all placeholder\n\t * * `'{' name '}'` - curly placeholder\n\t * * `'{' name ':' regexp|type '}'` - curly placeholder with regexp or type name. Should the\n\t *   regexp itself contain curly braces, they must be in matched pairs or escaped with a backslash.\n\t *\n\t * Parameter names may contain only word characters (latin letters, digits, and underscore) and\n\t * must be unique within the pattern (across both path and search parameters). For colon\n\t * placeholders or curly placeholders without an explicit regexp, a path parameter matches any\n\t * number of characters other than '/'. For catch-all placeholders the path parameter matches\n\t * any number of characters.\n\t *\n\t * Examples:\n\t *\n\t * * `'/hello/'` - Matches only if the path is exactly '/hello/'. There is no special treatment for\n\t *   trailing slashes, and patterns have to match the entire path, not just a prefix.\n\t * * `'/user/:id'` - Matches '/user/bob' or '/user/1234!!!' or even '/user/' but not '/user' or\n\t *   '/user/bob/details'. The second path segment will be captured as the parameter 'id'.\n\t * * `'/user/{id}'` - Same as the previous example, but using curly brace syntax.\n\t * * `'/user/{id:[^/]*}'` - Same as the previous example.\n\t * * `'/user/{id:[0-9a-fA-F]{1,8}}'` - Similar to the previous example, but only matches if the id\n\t *   parameter consists of 1 to 8 hex digits.\n\t * * `'/files/{path:.*}'` - Matches any URL starting with '/files/' and captures the rest of the\n\t *   path into the parameter 'path'.\n\t * * `'/files/*path'` - ditto.\n\t * * `'/calendar/{start:date}'` - Matches \"/calendar/2014-11-12\" (because the pattern defined\n\t *   in the built-in  `date` Type matches `2014-11-12`) and provides a Date object in $stateParams.start\n\t *\n\t * @param {string} pattern  The pattern to compile into a matcher.\n\t * @param {Object} config  A configuration object hash:\n\t * @param {Object=} parentMatcher Used to concatenate the pattern/config onto\n\t *   an existing UrlMatcher\n\t *\n\t * * `caseInsensitive` - `true` if URL matching should be case insensitive, otherwise `false`, the default value (for backward compatibility) is `false`.\n\t * * `strict` - `false` if matching against a URL with a trailing slash should be treated as equivalent to a URL without a trailing slash, the default value is `true`.\n\t *\n\t * @property {string} prefix  A static prefix of this pattern.

A URL pattern consists of a path pattern, optionally followed by '?' and a list\n * of search parameters. Multiple search parameter names are separated by '&'. Search parameters\n * do not influence whether or not a URL is matched, but their values are passed through into\n * the matched parameters returned by {@link ui.router.util.type:UrlMatcher#methods_exec exec}.\n *\n * Path parameter placeholders can be specified using simple colon/catch-all syntax or curly brace\n * syntax, which optionally allows a regular expression for the parameter to be specified:\n *\n * * `':'` name - colon placeholder\n * * `'*'` name - catch-all placeholder\n * * `'{' name '}'` - curly placeholder\n * * `'{' name ':' regexp|type '}'` - curly placeholder with regexp or type name. Should the\n *   regexp itself contain curly braces, they must be in matched pairs or escaped with a backslash.\n *\n * Parameter names may contain only word characters (latin letters, digits, and underscore) and\n * must be unique within the pattern (across both path and search parameters). For colon\n * placeholders or curly placeholders without an explicit regexp, a path parameter matches any\n * number of characters other than '/'. For catch-all placeholders the path parameter matches\n * any number of characters.\n *\n * Examples:\n *\n * * `'/hello/'` - Matches only if the path is exactly '/hello/'. There is no special treatment for\n *   trailing slashes, and patterns have to match the entire path, not just a prefix.\n * * `'/user/:id'` - Matches '/user/bob' or '/user/1234!!!' or even '/user/' but not '/user' or\n *   '/user/bob/details'. The second path segment will be captured as the parameter 'id'.\n * * `'/user/{id}'` - Same as the previous example, but using curly brace syntax.\n * * `'/user/{id:[^/]*}'` - Same as the previous example.\n * * `'/user/{id:[0-9a-fA-F]{1,8}}'` - Similar to the previous example, but only matches if the id\n *   parameter consists of 1 to 8 hex digits.\n * * `'/files/{path:.*}'` - Matches any URL starting with '/files/' and captures the rest of the\n *   path into the parameter 'path'.\n * * `'/files/*path'` - ditto.\n * * `'/calendar/{start:date}'` - Matches \"/calendar/2014-11-12\" (because the pattern defined\n *   in the built-in  `date` Type matches `2014-11-12`) and provides a Date object in $stateParams.start\n *\n * @param {string} pattern  The pattern to compile into a matcher.\n * @param {Object} config  A configuration object hash:\n * @param {Object=} parentMatcher Used to concatenate the pattern/config onto\n *   an existing UrlMatcher\n *\n * * `caseInsensitive` - `true` if URL matching should be case insensitive, otherwise `false`, the default value (for backward compatibility) is `false`.\n * * `strict` - `false` if matching against a URL with a trailing slash should be treated as equivalent to a URL without a trailing slash, the default value is `true`.\n *\n * @property {string} prefix  A static prefix of this pattern. The matcher guarantees that any\n *   URL matching this matcher (i.e. any string for which {@link ui.router.util.type:UrlMatcher#methods_exec exec()} returns\n *   non-null) will start with this prefix.\n *\n * @property {string} source  The pattern that was passed into the constructor\n *\n * @property {string} sourcePath  The path portion of the source property\n *\n * @property {string} sourceSearch  The search portion of the source property\n *\n * @property {string} regex  The constructed regex that will be used to match against the url when\n *   it is time to determine which url will match.\n *\n * @returns {Object}  New `UrlMatcher` object\n */\nfunction UrlMatcher(pattern, config, parentMatcher) {\n  config = extend({ params: {} }, isObject(config) ? config : {});\n\n  // Find all placeholders and create a compiled pattern, using either classic or curly syntax:\n  //   '*' name\n  //   ':' name\n  //   '{' name '}'\n  //   '{' name ':' regexp '}'\n  // The regular expression is somewhat complicated due to the need to allow curly braces\n  // inside the regular expression.

If `value` is a function,\n   *     it will be injected and invoked, and the return value used.\n   *\n   *     *Note*: `undefined` is treated as \"no default value\" while `null`\n   *     is treated as \"the default value is `null`\".\n   *\n   *     *Shorthand*: If you only need to configure the default value of the\n   *     parameter, you may use a shorthand syntax.   In the **`params`**\n   *     map, instead mapping the param name to a full parameter configuration\n   *     object, simply set map it to the default parameter value, e.g.:\n   *\n   * <pre>// define a parameter's default value\n   * params: {\n   *     param1: { value: \"defaultValue\" }\n   * }\n   * // shorthand default values\n   * params: {\n   *     param1: \"defaultValue\",\n   *     param2: \"param2Default\"\n   * }</pre>\n   *\n   *   - ** array ** - {boolean=}: *(default: false)* If true, the param value will be\n   *     treated as an array of values.  If you specified a Type, the value will be\n   *     treated as an array of the specified Type.  Note: query parameter values\n   *     default to a special `\"auto\"` mode.\n   *\n   *     For query parameters in `\"auto\"` mode, if multiple  values for a single parameter\n   *     are present in the URL (e.g.: `/foo?bar=1&bar=2&bar=3`) then the values\n   *     are mapped to an array (e.g.: `{ foo: [ '1', '2', '3' ] }`).  However, if\n   *     only one value is present (e.g.: `/foo?bar=1`) then the value is treated as single\n   *     value (e.g.: `{ foo: '1' }`).\n   *\n   * <pre>params: {\n   *     param1: { array: true }\n   * }</pre>\n   *\n   *   - ** squash ** - {bool|string=}: `squash` configures how a default parameter value is represented in the URL when\n   *     the current parameter value is the same as the default value. If `squash` is not set, it uses the\n   *     configured default squash policy.\n   *     (See {@link ui.router.util.$urlMatcherFactory#methods_defaultSquashPolicy `defaultSquashPolicy()`})\n   *\n   *   There are three squash settings:\n   *\n   *     - false: The parameter's default value is not squashed.  It is encoded and included in the URL\n   *     - true: The parameter's default value is omitted from the URL.  If the parameter is preceeded and followed\n   *       by slashes in the state's `url` declaration, then one of those slashes are omitted.\n   *       This can allow for cleaner looking URLs.\n   *     - `\"<arbitrary string>\"`: The parameter's default value is replaced with an arbitrary placeholder of  your choice.\n   *\n   * <pre>params: {\n   *     param1: {\n   *       value: \"defaultId\",\n   *       squash: true\n   * } }\n   * // squash \"defaultValue\" to \"~\"\n   * params: {\n   *     param1: {\n   *       value: \"defaultValue\",\n   *       squash: \"~\"\n   * } }\n   * </pre>\n   *\n   *\n   * @example\n   * <pre>\n   * // Some state name examples\n   *\n   * // stateName can be a single top-level name (must be unique).\n   * $stateProvider.state(\"home\", {});\n   *\n   * // Or it can be a nested state name.

The name should be unique amongst the other views in the\n * same state. You can have views of the same name that live in different states.\n *\n * @param {string=} autoscroll It allows you to set the scroll behavior of the browser window\n * when a view is populated. By default, $anchorScroll is overridden by ui-router's custom scroll\n * service, {@link ui.router.state.$uiViewScroll}. This custom service let's you\n * scroll ui-view elements into view when they are populated during a state activation.\n *\n * *Note: To revert back to old [`$anchorScroll`](http://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng.$anchorScroll)\n * functionality, call `$uiViewScrollProvider.useAnchorScroll()`.*\n *\n * @param {string=} onload Expression to evaluate whenever the view updates.\n *\n * @example\n * A view can be unnamed or named.\n * <pre>\n * <!-- Unnamed -->\n * <div ui-view></div>\n *\n * <!-- Named -->\n * <div ui-view=\"viewName\"></div>\n * </pre>\n *\n * You can only have one unnamed view within any template (or root html). If you are only using a\n * single view and it is unnamed then you can populate it like so:\n * <pre>\n * <div ui-view></div>\n * $stateProvider.state(\"home\", {\n *   template: \"<h1>HELLO!</h1>\"\n * })\n * </pre>\n *\n * The above is a convenient shortcut equivalent to specifying your view explicitly with the {@link ui.router.state.$stateProvider#methods_state `views`}\n * config property, by name, in this case an empty name:\n * <pre>\n * $stateProvider.state(\"home\", {\n *   views: {\n *     \"\": {\n *       template: \"<h1>HELLO!</h1>\"\n *     }\n *   }    \n * })\n * </pre>\n *\n * But typically you'll only use the views property if you name your view or have more than one view\n * in the same template. There's not really a compelling reason to name a view if its the only one,\n * but you could if you wanted, like so:\n * <pre>\n * <div ui-view=\"main\"></div>\n * </pre>\n * <pre>\n * $stateProvider.state(\"home\", {\n *   views: {\n *     \"main\": {\n *       template: \"<h1>HELLO!</h1>\"\n *     }\n *   }    \n * })\n * </pre>\n *\n * Really though, you'll use views to set up multiple views:\n * <pre>\n * <div ui-view></div>\n * <div ui-view=\"chart\"></div>\n * <div ui-view=\"data\"></div>\n * </pre>\n *\n * <pre>\n * $stateProvider.state(\"home\", {\n *   views: {\n *     \"\": {\n *       template: \"<h1>HELLO!</h1>\"\n *     },\n *     \"chart\": {\n *       template: \"<chart_thing/>\"\n *     },\n *     \"data\": {\n *       template: \"<data_thing/>\"\n *     }\n *   }    \n * })\n * </pre>\n *\n * Examples for `autoscroll`:\n *\n * <pre>\n * <!-- If autoscroll present with no expression,\n *      then scroll ui-view into view -->\n * <ui-view autoscroll/>\n *\n * <!-- If autoscroll present with valid expression,\n *      then scroll ui-view into view if expression evaluates to true -->\n * <ui-view autoscroll='true'/>\n * <ui-view autoscroll='false'/>\n * <ui-view autoscroll='scopeVariable'/>\n * </pre>\n *\n * Resolve data:\n *\n * The resolved data from the state's `resolve` block is placed on the scope as `$resolve` (this\n * can be customized using [[ViewDeclaration.resolveAs]]).  This can be then accessed from the template.\n *\n * Note that when `controllerAs` is being used, `$resolve` is set on the controller instance *after* the\n * controller is instantiated.  The `$onInit()` hook can be used to perform initialization code which\n * depends on `$resolve` data.\n *\n * Example usage of $resolve in a view template\n * <pre>\n * $stateProvider.state('home', {\n *   template: '<my-component user=\"$resolve.user\"></my-component>',\n *   resolve: {\n *     user: function(UserService) { return UserService.fetchUser(); }\n *   }\n * });\n * </pre>\n

If the state has an associated\n * URL, the directive will automatically generate & update the `href` attribute via\n * the {@link ui.router.state.$state#methods_href $state.href()} method. Clicking\n * the link will trigger a state transition with optional parameters.\n *\n * Also middle-clicking, right-clicking, and ctrl-clicking on the link will be\n * handled natively by the browser.\n *\n * You can also use relative state paths within ui-sref, just like the relative\n * paths passed to `$state.go()`. You just need to be aware that the path is relative\n * to the state that the link lives in, in other words the state that loaded the\n * template containing the link.\n *\n * You can specify options to pass to {@link ui.router.state.$state#methods_go $state.go()}\n * using the `ui-sref-opts` attribute. Options are restricted to `location`, `inherit`,\n * and `reload`.\n *\n * @example\n * Here's an example of how you'd use ui-sref and how it would compile. If you have the\n * following template:\n * <pre>\n * <a ui-sref=\"home\">Home</a> | <a ui-sref=\"about\">About</a> | <a ui-sref=\"{page: 2}\">Next page</a>\n *\n * <ul>\n *     <li ng-repeat=\"contact in contacts\">\n *         <a ui-sref=\"contacts.detail({ id: contact.id })\">{{ contact.name }}</a>\n *     </li>\n * </ul>\n * </pre>\n *\n * Then the compiled html would be (assuming Html5Mode is off and current state is contacts):\n * <pre>\n * <a href=\"#/home\" ui-sref=\"home\">Home</a> | <a href=\"#/about\" ui-sref=\"about\">About</a> | <a href=\"#/contacts?page=2\" ui-sref=\"{page: 2}\">Next page</a>\n *\n * <ul>\n *     <li ng-repeat=\"contact in contacts\">\n *         <a href=\"#/contacts/1\" ui-sref=\"contacts.detail({ id: contact.id })\">Joe</a>\n *     </li>\n *     <li ng-repeat=\"contact in contacts\">\n *         <a href=\"#/contacts/2\" ui-sref=\"contacts.detail({ id: contact.id })\">Alice</a>\n *     </li>\n *     <li ng-repeat=\"contact in contacts\">\n *         <a href=\"#/contacts/3\" ui-sref=\"contacts.detail({ id: contact.id })\">Bob</a>\n *     </li>\n * </ul>\n *\n * <a ui-sref=\"home\" ui-sref-opts=\"{reload: true}\">Home</a>\n * </pre>\n *\n * @param {string} ui-sref 'stateName' can be any valid absolute or relative state\n * @param {Object} ui-sref-opts options to pass to {@link ui.router.state.$state#methods_go $state.go()}\n */\n$StateRefDirective.$inject = ['$state', '$timeout'];\nfunction $StateRefDirective($state, $timeout) {\n  return {\n    restrict: 'A',\n    require: ['?^uiSrefActive', '?^uiSrefActiveEq'],\n    link: function(scope, element, attrs, uiSrefActive) {\n      var ref    = parseStateRef(attrs.uiSref, $state.current.name);\n      var def    = { state: ref.state, href: null, params: null };\n      var type   = getTypeInfo(element);\n      var active = uiSrefActive[1] || uiSrefActive[0];\n      var unlinkInfoFn = null;\n      var hookFn;\n\n      def.options = extend(defaultOpts(element, $state), attrs.uiSrefOpts ?
